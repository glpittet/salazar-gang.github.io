# Climate change is a global emergency !
### Public opinion on climate change: a barrier that is part of the solution
Nowadays, man-made climate change and global warming have become an emergency that goes far beyond national boundaries and certainly represents one of the **greatest challenges humankind has ever faced**. In fact, because of direct consequences like heat waves, more frequent and intense storms, rising sea levels, warming of the oceans and many others, humans, but most importantly animals, face new challenges for survival. In order to limit as much as possible the damages, **concrete actions need to be undertaken**.<br />
<br />
However, still **~30% of the worldwide population views climate change as a minor threat or not a threat at all** and do not consider the matter as an emergency[^1]. This constitutes a huge barrier in adressing climate change as shifting the public opinion is needed to encourage climate-friendly behaviours. Therefore, changing public opinion may be a huge part of the solution but also one of the greatest challenges. This is why **identifying the factors that influence public views on climate change is a critical step** to urge politics to propose solutions on the matter and convince the population to act daily. Furthermore, **visibility of the topic in the media is crucial** to sensitize the population on the severity of the situation.

We therefore decided to first evaluate the occurence of climate change and global warming in the discussed matters on the newspapers. We then analysed the influence of the social context (age, academic degree, profession, political partyâ€¦) on the opinions of climate change using the [QuoteBank dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4277311#.YboGUC_pOPQ) to answer several questions listed below.

# How much is climate change mentioned in the news ?
### An increased tendency through the years...
To have a better idea on the importance the news give to the topic of global warming and climate change, we asked ourselves an obvious but important question:<br /> 
<center><b>How much do speakers talk about climate change in the news ? Do they talk about it at all ?</b></center>
<br />To answer these questions, we first sorted the quotes of the QuoteBank dataset in order to keep only the quotes related to climate change by keyword search. We were then able to visualize the occurence of climate-related quotes through the years, from 2008 to 2020:

Because global warming is becoming a more and more serious problem in our society, we expected an increase in the occurence of the topic through the years. In fact, we can observe in this first plot an overall increased tendency of climate-related quotes. Interestingly, the end of the year 2009 also shows a higher occurence. Several hypothesis could explain that phenomenon:<br />
- First, at that time 2009 was tied for the second warmest year in the modern record by the NASA[^2], which could explain why global warming was a particular hot topic during this time period.<br />
- It is also possible that the QuoteBank dataset contains more quotes from December 2009 than from other time periods, thereby producing a bias.

### And through the months ?
An other interesting fact that one can observe from this plot is the increase in the occurence of climate-related quotes at the end of the year. But is it really the case ? Let's have a closer look at this:
<br />
<iframe frameborder="no" border="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="100%" height="550" src="html/occurence_month.html"></iframe>
<br /> If we look more precisely at the plot above, there only is a significant increase at the end of the year in 2009 and 2015. This could be completely random or partialy explained by the arguments cited above for 2009.

### A correlation with the increase in global temperature ?
