# Climate change is a global emergency !
### Public opinion on climate change: a barrier that is part of the solution
Nowadays, man-made climate change and global warming have become an emergency that goes far beyond national boundaries and certainly represents one of the **greatest challenges humankind has ever faced**. In fact, because of direct consequences like heat waves, more frequent and intense storms, rising sea levels, warming of the oceans and many others, humans, but most importantly animals, face new challenges for survival. In order to limit as much as possible the damages, **concrete actions need to be undertaken**.<br />

However, still **~30% of the worldwide population views climate change as a minor threat or not a threat at all** and do not consider the matter as an emergency[^1]. This constitutes a huge barrier in adressing climate change as shifting the public opinion is needed to encourage climate-friendly behaviours. Therefore, changing public opinion may be a huge part of the solution but also one of the greatest challenges. This is why **identifying the factors that influence public views on climate change is a critical step** to urge politics to propose solutions on the matter and convince the population to act daily. One of these influences certainly is the **media coverage of the topic** that sensitizes the population on the severity of the situation.

This data story explores the [QuoteBank dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4277311#.YboGUC_pOPQ) to evaluate the occurence of the topic of climate change in the English news as well as its correlation with several parameters to better understand its influence on the population's interest on the matter. We pushed our analysis further by assessing the influence of the social context of the speakers (age, occupaction, political party, academic degree, nationalityâ€¦) on the opinions on climate change using sentimental analysis.

# How much is climate change mentioned in the news ?
### An increased tendency through the years...
This question can seem quite obvious and simple to answer. However, to have a better idea on the importance the news give to the topic and the influence they have on the public opinion, we need to first find out how much climate change is mentioned and whether it correlates with the gravity of the situation.

To answer this question, we first sorted the quotes of the QuoteBank dataset in order to keep only the quotes related to climate change by **keyword search**. the following keywords were chosen by our wonderful team:
- Climate change
- Global warming
- Greenhouse effect
- Greenhouse gas
- Climate crisis
- Climate emergency
- Climate breakdown

We were then able to visualize the occurence of climate change-related quotes through the years, from 2008 to 2020:

We can observe in this first plot an overall **increased tendency of quotes related to climate change through the years**. This result isn't a surprise for us as we hypothesize that the more the situation worsens, the more the news talk about it. We'll come back to this later.<br /> 
Interestingly, **the end of the year 2009 also shows a higher occurence**. Several hypothesis could explain that phenomenon:
- First, at that time, 2009 was tied for the **second warmest year in the modern record** by the NASA[^2], which could explain why global warming was a particularly hot topic during this time period.<br />
- It is also possible that the QuoteBank dataset contains more quotes from December 2009 than from other time periods, thereby yielding a bias.

### And through the months ?
An other interesting fact that one can observe from this plot is the **increase in the occurence of climate change-related quotes at the end of certain years**. Let's have a closer look at this:

<iframe frameborder="no" border="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="100%" height="550" src="html/occurence_month.html"></iframe>

<div class="withSidenote" markdown="1">

If we look more precisely at the plot above, there only is a significant increase at the end of the year in 2009 and 2015. This could be completely random or partialy explained by the arguments cited above in the case of 2009. Interestingly, **2015 belonged to the top 3 warmest years on record until 2019**[^3]. This could explain the peak in global warming-related quotes at the end of 2015. More generally, media coverage of climate change tends to increase at the end of the year while annual reports of global temperature anomalies and other data are published at that moment. We are therefore not surprised by these results.

# The worst the situation gets, the more interest on the topic
### A correlation with the increase in global temperature ?
To understand whether the observed increase in climate related-quotes through the years is in fact due to the aggravation of the situation, we ploted the correlation between the monthly temperature anomaly (refering to the difference from the average, normal, temperature) and the monthly occurence of quotes mentioning climate change. To do so, we retrived the [HadCRUT5 dataset of global historical surface temperature anomalies](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/data/current/download.html).

Even if the correlation isn't significantly high, we can still observe a **positive correlation** with a R^2 value of ~0.12 which stays consistent with the hypothesis that **the more the situation gets worse, the highest chance the news will talk about it**. Yet, this correlation isn't strong enough to conclude anything relevant. 

### The news talk about it, people google it
To evaluate the influence of the media on public opinion, we thought of comparing the [Google trends of climate change-related web searches](https://trends.google.fr/trends/explore?date=2009-01-01%202019-12-31&q=climate%20change) with the occurence of the quotes on the topic to assess whether media coverage could encourage people to get more informed on the subject.

<iframe frameborder="no" border="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="100%" height="550" src="html/correlation_google.html"></iframe>

Interestingly, we can observe a **significant correlation** with a R^2 of ~0.61, meaning that people do **tend to get informed on subjects that the news cover**. Surprisingly, we can even notice that the highest web search trend corresponds to the highest climate change related-quote occurence, in September 2019. Did something particular happened in September 2019 ?
